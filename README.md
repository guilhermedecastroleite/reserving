# Reserving

## About

This project is a study on websites for hotel booking. It takes some usability and design clues from Booking.com and other hotel booking websites. It's sole purpose is for me to practice some tech that I'm currently interested in.

## Tech Stack

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Design

The design is based on an open design by [Nischal Kharel on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1219890698200192960).\
It's important to notice that some changes were made to better optimize the website, so it's not a 1:1 implementation of what's on Figma, and that's on purpose.

## Deployed Version

https://reserving.vercel.app/

## Running

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
